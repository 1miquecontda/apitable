A No CD Crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without the CD. This can be useful if you have lost or damaged your CD, or if you want to save your CD drive from wear and tear. However, using a No CD Crack may also have some drawbacks, such as compatibility issues with patches, mods, or online features. Therefore, use it at your own risk and only if you own a legal copy of the game.
 
To use a No CD Crack for Herr Der Ringe Schlacht Um Mittelerde 2, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download a No CD Crack that matches your game version from a reliable source. For example, you can find some No CD Cracks for different versions of the game at [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_lotr_battle_for_middle-earth_2.shtml) [^1^]. Make sure you scan the file for viruses before opening it.
2. Backup your original game executable file (lotrbfme2.exe) in case something goes wrong. You can find it in your game installation folder, usually at C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle-earth II.
3. Copy and paste the No CD Crack file (also named lotrbfme2.exe) into your game installation folder, replacing the original file.
4. Run the game as usual. You should be able to play without inserting the CD.

Note that some No CD Cracks may require additional steps or files to work properly. Read the instructions that come with the file carefully and follow them accordingly.
 
If you want to play with mods or online features, you may need to update your game to the latest version or use a different No CD Crack that supports them. For example, if you want to play with the HD Edition mod [^3^], you need to patch your game to 2.02 v9.0.0 and use a compatible No CD Crack [^1^]. If you want to play online with other players, you need to register your game on T3A:Online and use their launcher [^4^].

- Learn how to use your heroes effectively. Each hero has unique abilities and strengths that can turn the tide of battle. For example, Gandalf can summon a powerful lightning strike, Aragorn can rally your troops and heal them, and Lurtz can cripple enemy heroes with his crossbow. Use your heroes wisely and level them up as soon as possible.
- Use the power points to unlock special powers. You can earn power points by destroying enemy buildings and units, or by capturing signal fires. You can use these points to unlock various powers that can help you in different situations. For example, you can summon reinforcements, heal your units, call an eagle or a dragon, or unleash a devastating attack on your enemies.
- Know your factions and their strengths. There are six factions in the game: Men, Elves, Dwarves, Mordor, Isengard, and Goblins. Each faction has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as different units, buildings, upgrades, and strategies. For example, Men have strong cavalry and heroes, Elves have powerful archers and magic, Dwarves have sturdy defenses and siege weapons, Mordor has cheap and numerous orcs and trolls, Isengard has heavily armored uruk-hai and wargs, and Goblins have fast and sneaky goblin warriors and spiders. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of each faction and use them to your advantage.
- Practice your micro-management skills. Micro-management is the ability to control your units individually or in small groups, rather than moving them all together. This can help you avoid unnecessary losses, exploit enemy weaknesses, and perform better in combat. For example, you can use your archers to focus fire on enemy heroes or siege weapons, use your cavalry to flank or harass enemy archers or builders, use your heroes to activate their abilities at the right time, or use your special powers to surprise or disrupt your enemies.
